    *   **Query:** "site:linkedin.com/in/ gamuda employee"

    *   **List of Initial URLs Extracted:**
        *   `https://www.linkedin.com/in/rozen-tason-49582a229`
        *   `https://my.linkedin.com/in/anita-ibrahim-1ab06237`
        *   `https://sg.linkedin.com/in/keam-tong-wong-60087933`
        *   `https://my.linkedin.com/in/lilly-cheng-9b271521`

        *   `https://sg.linkedin.com/in/yijialim`
        *   `https://au.linkedin.com/in/lu-ling-ng-b6aa23b`
        *   `https://my.linkedin.com/in/suechern-l-349a5b129`
        *   `https://my.linkedin.com/in/ameerul29`
*   **2. Fetching Individual Profile Data:**
    *   **Tool Used:** `BrightData.web_data_linkedin_person_profile`
    *   **Process:** Attempted to fetch data for each URL sequentially.
    *   **Outcomes:**
        *   **Successfully Fetched:**
            *   Rozen Tason (`https://www.linkedin.com/in/rozen-tason-49582a229`)
            *   Anita Ibrahim (`https://my.linkedin.com/in/anita-ibrahim-1ab06237`)
            *   Janeille Ledesma Loveria (`https://sg.linkedin.com/in/janeille-loveria-mcmxcii`)

            *   Yi Jia Lim (`https://sg.linkedin.com/in/yijialim`) - Timeout

**Current Status:**

*   Successfully fetched data for 3 profiles.
*   Encountered multiple timeouts when attempting to fetch other profiles, indicating potential instability or rate-limiting with this sequential fetching method for LinkedIn profiles.
*   Paused further individual profile fetching attempts.
